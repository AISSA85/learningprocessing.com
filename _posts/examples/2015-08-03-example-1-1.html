<p>By adding the <code>stroke()</code> and <code>fill()</code> functions <em>before</em> the shape is drawn, you can set the color. Itâ€™s much like instructing your friend to use a specific pen to draw on the graph paper. You would have to tell your friend <em>before</em> he or she starting drawing, not after.</p>

<p>There is also the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="background() function" data-type="indexterm">&nbsp;</a> function <code>background()</code>, which sets a background color for the window where shapes will be rendered.</p>
